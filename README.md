# Intro to Scala 
### Object-oriented meets functional
---

+ Scala, short for Scalable Language, is a hybrid functional programming language. 

+ It was created in 2001 by Martin Odersky and released publicly in 2004.

+ It smoothly integrates the features of object-oriented and functional languages. 

+ Scala is compiled into Java Byte Code, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine.

### Why Scala?

Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits.

It's also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value and every value is an object, so ultimately every function is an object.

Because of its type inference and other features, Scala is a very succinct language, which allows developers to reduce the size of source code by at least a factor of two or three, compared to languages like Java. 

It's also is bundled with a rich set of developer tools, comparing to languages like Ruby or Python.

Scalability - it has a wide range of both high-quality frameworks and libraries for incorporation into apps.

Scala is equipped with an expressive type system that detects and avoids many kinds of application errors at compile time. 

### More Facts About Scala

+ The type system of Scala is Turing complete.

+ Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions were inspired by criticism of the shortcomings of Java.

+ Scala also can compile to JavaScript, making it possible to write Scala programs that can run in web browsers.
